# Licenta

This is my Diploma Thesis and the practical project I developed as a proof of concept alongside the written paper.

The project is made up of a Unity Editor extension that enables animation editing and viewing AI traning results as well as managing
and comunicating with a Python/Flask back-end that is responsible for the AI model training. The back-end is run locally and uses both 
REST endpoints as well as files to transfer data to and from the Unity front-end.
